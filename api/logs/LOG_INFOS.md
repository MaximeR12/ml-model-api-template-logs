# API Logging Documentation

This document explains the logs generated by the API and how to interpret them.

## Log Types

The API generates logs of various types to capture different events and activities. The following log types are utilized:

1. **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging purposes.
2. **INFO**: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a coarse-grained level.
3. **ERROR**: Indicates errors that occur during the execution of the application.

## Log Format

All logs follow a standardized format:
[timestamp] - [log_level] - [logger_name] - [log_message]

- **timestamp**: The date and time when the log was generated.
- **log_level**: The severity level of the log message (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
- **logger_name**: The name of the logger that generated the log message.
- **log_message**: The actual content of the log message.

## Log Handlers

The API uses two main log handlers:

1. **Console Handler**: Logs are printed to the console.
2. **File Handler**: Logs are written to a file located in the `./api/logs` directory.

## Log Levels

### DEBUG

- **Description**: Detailed information useful for debugging purposes.
- **When to Use**: Use this level to provide detailed information during debugging or troubleshooting.

### INFO

- **Description**: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
- **When to Use**: Use this level to track the progress of various activities within the application.

### ERROR

- **Description**: Indicates errors that occur during the execution of the application.
- **When to Use**: Use this level to identify and troubleshoot errors encountered by the application.

## Interpreting Logs

- **DEBUG Logs**: Use these logs for detailed debugging information. They can help trace the flow of execution and identify issues in the code.
- **INFO Logs**: These logs provide high-level information about the progress of the application. Use them to monitor the overall activity and performance.
- **ERROR Logs**: When errors occur, refer to these logs to diagnose and resolve issues that may impact the functionality of the API.

## Log Files

Log files are stored in the `./api/logs` directory. Each log file captures a history of events and activities logged during the operation of the API.

### Log File Rotation

Log files are rotated to manage their size and ensure efficient storage. The API configures log rotation to keep a maximum of three backup log files, each with a maximum size of 10 MB.
